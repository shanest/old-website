  abstract: >-
    The vocabulary of human languages has been argued to support efficient
    communication by optimizing the trade-off between complexity and
    informativeness (Kemp & Regier 2012). The argument has been based on
    cross-linguistic analyses of vocabulary in semantic domains of content words
    such as kinship, color, and number terms. The present work extends this
    analysis to a category of function words: indefinite pronouns (e.g. someone,
    anyone, no-one, cf. Haspelmath 2001). We build on previous work to establish
    the meaning space and featural make-up for indefinite pronouns, and show
    that indefinite pronoun systems across languages optimize the
    complexity/informativeness trade-off. This demonstrates that pressures for
    efficient communication shape both content and function word categories,
    thus tying in with the conclusions of recent work on quantifiers by
    Steinert-Threlkeld (2019). Furthermore, we argue that the trade-off may
    explain some of the universal properties of indefinite pronouns, thus
    reducing the explanatory load for linguistic theories.

    We propose a general framework to study language emergence through signaling
    games with neural agents. Using a continuous latent space, we are able to
    (i) train using backpropagation, (ii) show that discrete messages
    nonetheless naturally emerge. We explore whether categorical perception
    effects follow and show that the messages are not compositional.

  abstract: >-
    We investigate, in a logical setting, the expressivist proposal that
    assertion primarily functions to express and coordinate doxastic states and
    that ‘might’ fundamentally expresses lack of belief. We provide a formal
    model of an agent’s doxastic state and novel assertability conditions for an
    associated formal language. We thereby prove that an arbitrary assertion
    (including a complex of ‘might’ and ‘factual’ claims) always succeeds in
    expressing a well-defined (partial) doxastic state, and propose a fully
    general and intuitive update operation as a model of an agent coming to
    accept an arbitrary assertion. Leaving a comprehensive philosophical and
    linguistic defense for elsewhere, we explore technical aspects of our
    framework, providing, for instance, a complete logic of assertability and
    reduction axioms for the novel update operations related to our proposal.
    Finally, we contrast our work with related proposals in the logic
    literature.

    Expressivists about epistemic modals deny that ‘Jane might be late’
    canonically serves to express the speaker’s acceptance of a certain
    propositional content. Instead, they hold that it expresses a lack of
    acceptance (that Jane isn’t late). Prominent expressivists embrace pragmatic
    expressivism: the doxastic property expressed by a declarative is not
    helpfully identified with (any part of) that sentence’s compositional
    semantic value. Against this, we defend semantic expressivism about
    epistemic modals: the semantic value of a declarative from this domain is
    (partly) the property of doxastic attitudes it canonically serves to
    express. In support, we synthesize data from the critical literature on
    expressivism—largely reflecting interactions between modals and
    disjunctions—and present a semantic expressivism that readily predicts the
    data. This contrasts with salient competitors, including: pragmatic
    expressivism based on domain semantics or dynamic semantics; semantic
    expressivism à la Moss (Semant Pragmat 8(5):1–81, 2015.
    https://doi.org/10.3765/sp.8.5); and the bounded relational semantics of
    Mandelkern (Philos Rev 128(1):1–61, 2019.

    How are the meanings of linguistic expressions related to their use in
    concrete cognitive tasks? Visual identification tasks show human speakers
    can exhibit considerable variation in their understanding, representation
    and verification of certain quantifiers. This paper initiates an
    investigation into neural models of these psycho-semantic tasks. We trained
    two types of network -- a convolutional neural network (CNN) model and a
    recurrent model of visual attention (RAM) -- on the "most" verification task
    from \citet{Pietroski2009}, manipulating the visual scene and novel notions
    of task duration. Our results qualitatively mirror certain features of human
    performance (such as sensitivity to the ratio of set sizes, indicating a
    reliance on approximate number) while differing in interesting ways (such as
    exhibiting a subtly different pattern for the effect of image type). We
    conclude by discussing the prospects for using neural models as cognitive
    models of this and other psychosemantic tasks.

    Interactive math tutorials, often called mathlets, are designed to provide a
    more visceral learning experience than traditional textbook methods and to
    enhance intuitive understanding of complex ideas by allowing users to alter
    parameters that influence visual scenes. We describe methods for creating
    such tutorials using the HTML5 canvas element. First, we discuss some
    motivations for writing such mathlets, then walk-through the process of
    creating a mathlet with canvas. Then, we compare canvas to alternatives,
    explaining our decision to use it, and provide links to other demonstrations
    and resources. Copyright 2012, All Rights Reserved, The Mathematical

  abstract: >-
    All natural languages exhibit a distinction between content words (like
    nouns and adjectives) and function words (like determiners, auxiliaries,
    prepositions). Yet surprisingly little has been said about the emergence of
    this universal architectural feature of natural languages. Why have human
    languages evolved to exhibit this division of labor between content and
    function words? How could such a distinction have emerged in the first
    place? This paper takes steps towards answering these questions by showing
    how the distinction can emerge through reinforcement learning in agents
    playing a signaling game across contexts which contain multiple objects that
    possess multiple perceptually salient gradable properties.

  abstract: >-
    While the languages of the world vary greatly, linguists have discovered
    many restrictions on possible variation. Semantic universals are
    restrictions on the range of variation in meaning across languages.
    Recently, in several domains-e.g. kinship terms, color terms-such universals
    have been argued to arise from a trade-off between simplicity and
    informativeness. In this paper, we apply this method to a prominent domain
    of functions words, showing that the quantifiers in natural language also
    appear to be optimized for this trade-off. We do this by using an
    evolutionary algorithm to estimate the optimal languages, systematically
    manipulating the degree of naturalness of languages, and showing that
    languages become closer to optimal as they become more natural. Our results
    suggest that very general communicative and cognitive pressures may shape
    the lexica of natural languages across both content and function words.

    Semantic universals are properties of meaning shared by the languages of the
    world. We offer an explanation of the presence of such universals by
    measuring simplicity in terms of ease of learning, showing that expressions
    satisfying universals are simpler than those that do not according to this
    criterion. We measure ease of learning using tools from machine learning and
    analyze universals in a domain of function words (quantifiers) and content
    words (color terms). Our results provide strong evidence that semantic
    universals across both function and content words reflect simplicity as
    measured by ease of learning.

    All natural languages exhibit a distinction between content words (nouns,
    verbs, etc.) and function words (determiners, auxiliaries, tenses, etc.).
    Yet surprisingly little has been said about the emergence of this universal
    architectural feature of human language. This article argues that the
    existence of this distinction requires the presence of nontrivial
    compositionality and identifies assumptions that have previously been made
    in the literature that provably guarantee only trivial composition. It then
    presents a signaling game with variable contexts and shows how the
    distinction can emerge via reinforcement learning.

  abstract: >-
    A semantic universal, which we here dub the Veridical Uniformity Universal,
    has recently been argued to hold of responsive verbs (those that take both
    declarative and interrogative complements). This paper offers a preliminary
    explanation of this universal: verbs satisfying it are easier to learn than
    those that do not. This claim is supported by a computational experiment
    using artificial neural networks, mirroring a recent proposal for explaining
    semantic universals of quantifiers. This preliminary study opens up many
    avenues for future work on explaining semantic universals more generally,
    which are discussed in the conclusion.

  abstract: >-
    One of the great successes of the application of generalized quantifiers to
    natural language has been the ability to formulate robust semantic
    universals. When such a universal is attested, the question arises as to the
    source of the universal. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that many
    semantic universals arise because expressions satisfying the universal are
    easier to learn than those that do not. While the idea that learnability
    explains universals is not new, explicit accounts of learning that can make
    good on this hypothesis are few and far between. We develop a model of
    learning — back-propogation through a recurrent neural network — which can
    make good on this promise. In particular, we discuss the universals of
    monotonicity, quantity, and conservativity and perform computational
    experiments of training such a network to learn to verify quantifiers. Our
    results are able to explain monotonicity and quantity quite well. We suggest
    that conservativity may have a different source than the other universals.

  abstract: >-
    A method for automated location of shape differences in diseased anatomical
    structures via high resolution biomedical atlases annotated with labels from
    formal ontologies is described. In particular, a high resolution magnetic
    resonance image of the myocardium of the human left ventricle was segmented
    and annotated with structural terms from an extracted subset of the
    Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology. The atlas was registered to the end
    systole template of a previous study of left ventricular remodeling in
    cardiomyopathy using a diffeomorphic registration algorithm. The previous
    study used thresholding and visual inspection to locate a region of
    statistical significance which distinguished patients with ischemic
    cardiomyopathy from those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Using semantic
    technologies and the deformed annotated atlas, this location was more
    precisely found. Although this study used only a cardiac atlas, it provides
    a proof-of-concept that ontologically labeled biomedical atlases of any
    anatomical structure can be used to automate location-based inferences. ©

    While the languages of the world vary greatly, they exhibit systematic
    patterns, as well. Semantic universals are restrictions on the variation in
    meaning exhibit cross-linguistically (e.g., that, in all languages,
    expressions of a certain type can only denote meanings with a certain
    special property). This paper pursues an efficient communication analysis to
    explain the presence of semantic universals in a domain of function words:
    quantifiers. Two experiments measure how well languages do in optimally
    trading off between competing pressures of simplicity and informativeness.
    First, we show that artificial languages which more closely resemble natural
    languages are more optimal. Then, we introduce information-theoretic
    measures of degrees of semantic universals and show that these are not
    correlated with optimality in a random sample of artificial languages. These
    results suggest both that efficient communication shapes semantic typology
    in both content and function word domains, as well as that semantic
    universals may not stand in need of independent explanation. asdf

  abstract: >-
    In recent years, the methods of formal semantics and pragmatics have been
    fruitfully applied to the analysis of primate communication systems. Most
    analyses therein appeal to a division of labor between semantics and
    pragmatics which has the following three features: (F1) calls are given
    referential meanings (they provide information about the world rather than
    just about an action to be taken), (F2) some calls have a general meaning,
    and (F3) the meanings of calls in context are enriched by competition with
    more informative calls, along the lines of scalar implicatures. In this
    paper, we develop highly simplified models to independently assess the
    conditions under which such features would emerge. After identifying a
    sufficient condition for (F1), we find a range of conditions under which
    (F2) and (F3) are not evolutionarily stable, and discuss the consequences
    for both modeling and empirical work.
